# precise-model

Trained on my local sample set combined with the public noise and speech commands dataset.  End result val_acc is .9999 with one false negative.  

If anything, I need more wake word samples from more varied sources.  Model probaly won't have great recognition for most as I am the primary source of wake word samples in it.
